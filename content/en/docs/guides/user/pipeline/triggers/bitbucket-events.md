## Overview of supported Bitbucket Server events

Spinnaker supports the following Bitbucket Server webhook events:

* Declined (pr:declined)
* Deleted (pr:deleted)
* Merged (pr:merged)
* Modified/Source branch updated (pr:from_ref_updated)
* Opened (pr:opened)
* Push (repo:refs_changed)


## Before you begin

* You are familiar with [creating and triggering webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/manage-webhooks-938025878.html) in Bithucket Server.
* You have configured [Bitbucket notifications (webhooks)]({{< ref "docs/setup/other_config/features/notifications/index.md#bitbucket-cloud" >}}) in Spinnaker and enabled the desired webhook events in your Bitbucket repository.

## Add a Bitbucket webhook event as a pipeline trigger

1. Configure a new trigger with the following information:

   * **Type**: `Git`

   * **Team or User**: enter your Bitbucket team or user name
   * **Repo name**: enter your Bitbucket repo name
